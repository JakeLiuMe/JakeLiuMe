Building at the intersection of **AI**, **automation**, and **quantitative systems**. I ship tools that make money, save time, and work while I sleep. Currently deep in agentic engineering — orchestrating AI agents across machines to build, monitor, and deploy software autonomously.

## Current Projects

💬 **[BuzzChat](https://github.com/JakeLiuMe/BuzzChat)** — AI-powered chat automation for live selling platforms. Chrome extension with auto-welcome, timed promotions, FAQ auto-replies, giveaway tracking, analytics, and **AI-generated responses** (the only tool in the space that has this). Supports Whatnot, YouTube, eBay, Twitch & Kick. 220+ automated tests. Coming to Chrome Web Store soon.

📈 **QuantOptions** — Quantitative options trading system. Real-time data pipelines, multi-component signal generation, backtesting framework, and automated execution engine. Built with Python + Node.js. *(Private)*

🤖 **Wilson & Jarvis** — Multi-machine AI agent setup using [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Wilson (Windows workstation) and Jarvis (Mac Mini server) coordinate tasks, monitor systems, and ship code — accessible from anywhere via Discord. Mission Control dashboard for real-time visibility.

🖥️ **Mission Control** — Live task dashboard for AI agent workflows. Kanban board, real-time activity feed, drag-drop, search, keyboard shortcuts. Deployed 24/7 on Hetzner Cloud with PM2.

✍️ **MyPersonalWriter** — AI writing assistant for content creation and editing workflows. *(Private)*

## GitHub Workflows & Automation

All my repos ship with serious CI/CD:

- 🔄 **Auto-Fix** — AI-powered issue resolution: comment `/autofix` on any issue, Claude analyzes the codebase and opens a draft PR with a fix
- 🧹 **Auto-Maintenance** — Weekly dependency updates, stale issue management, security vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **Full Test Suite** — 220+ Playwright tests running on every PR
- 🔒 **Security Auditing** — Automated `npm audit`, credential scanning, dependency review

## Philosophy

> **Ship it, then improve it.** Build tools that solve your own problems, automate the tedious, and let AI handle the rest. The best code is the code that writes itself.

I believe we're in the early days of **agentic engineering** — where AI agents don't just assist, they *do*. I'm building the infrastructure to make that real: agents that code, deploy, monitor, and iterate autonomously.
